      <h1>The Path to the Glukit 1.0 Preview <span class="date">[August 22 2014]</span></h1>

       <div class="post content">
        

<p>People who know me can attest to this (I hope): once I commit myself to doing something, I do it. Even if it makes my life miserable. Even if no one is looking and the cost of giving up is nil.</p>

<p>I do it because I need to create <em>something</em>. I do it because I know that the result might be worth it. I do it because I know that working on something brings a great satisfaction only on successful completion of it.</p>

<p>I started working on <a href="http://www.mygluk.it">glukit</a> in March 2013. We&rsquo;re in August 2014, 16 months later. After an initial functional app, I had a good idea of what the minimal set of features I wanted in the 1.0 preview release. And I wanted to get that first release out. So I committed myself to making 1 commit every day until I got all of it done.</p>

<p>This got me a streak of <a href="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5561/15004911492_19aca9abd5_c.jpg">200 days of commits</a> on <a href="http://github.com">github</a>. The funny thing is that I realized only after getting hooked that my streak would only ever be visible to me because my repositories are private. But that&rsquo;s not why the feature is powerful. There might be a social aspect to it but, to me, this was another behavioral science trick to help me get to a desired outcome.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">The Dark Side</h3>

<p>Now what? I&rsquo;ve gone through the making of successful creative projects like this one before. The hard part if always the life <em>after</em>. The truth is that I feel exhausted from having worked so hard without a pause for so long. That hard work and dedication got me to a significant milestone. But, now at that milestone, it&rsquo;s hard to find the energy to commit to the next phase.</p>

<h4 id="toc_1">Recharging</h4>

<p>The first day of my 2 weeks family vacation was the day I made the commit that marked the 200th day. I knew I had to wrap-up before losing focus. I&rsquo;m afraid that taking a break will get me to move away enough that I won&rsquo;t want to get back to it. I might get drawn to something new like drawing or writing a book.</p>

<h4 id="toc_2">You</h4>

<p>But <a href="http://www.mygluk.it/">glukit</a> is also different. I did commit before I left that I would return from vacation to announce the preview release of <a href="http://www.mygluk.it/">glukit</a>. If I was successful in creating a convincing presentation of my idea for a <em>better</em>, behavioral science powered diabetes application, maybe you&rsquo;ll have something to tell me. Comments, suggestions, requests. I worked on <a href="http://www.mygluk.it/">glukit</a> for so long that I can&rsquo;t see clearly anymore if it&rsquo;s any good or if it can be effective like I imagined it.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll <a href="mailto:alexandre.normand@mygluk.it">tell me</a>.</p>

<p>It probably sucks. But if you think it has the potential <em>not</em> to suck, I&rsquo;d be excited to hear it.</p>

<p>Your <a href="mailto:alexandre.normand@mygluk.it">emails</a> might be what fuels my next commit streak.</p>

<p>Love,</p>
