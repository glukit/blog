Title: New Glukloader Version for Dexcom 505 Firmware Upgrade
---

Dexcom released their new [505 firmware version](https://store.dexcom.com/user/login?destination=update-tool) earlier this week and I was happy to give it a try. I haven't used the new version yet to confirm how better it is, but it's looking promising. With that news also came the realization that Glukloader wasn't quite ready for the case of receivers being reset. Thankfully, addressing it wasn't very difficult.

I also got rid of the colors in the Glukloader menu bar icon. Glukloader should now fit more elegantly in the menu bar next to other black and white icons. 

That's it. You'll find the new version [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3208429/glukloader%201.0.0.dmg?dl=1). 

Cheers,
