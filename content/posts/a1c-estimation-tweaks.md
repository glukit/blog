Title: A1C Estimation Tweaks
---

I just realized today that my a1c color wheel wasn't rendering properly on Safari. It's now fixed. If you were using Safari, now the a1c display should make a lot more sense. Firefox should also be covered if you're using a recent version.

I also made a small tweak to the a1c calculation which should result in slightly higher values. I believe this should be more accurate but I don't have enough samples to actually know for sure. 

Again, I'd like to hear about your experience with this feature. Refer to my [previous post](/posts/a1c-estimation) for my suggested experiment. 

Don't hesitate to tell me what your experience is with this. [Email me](mailto:alexandre.normand@gmail.com)! 

Cheers,
