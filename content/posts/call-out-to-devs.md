Title: A Call Out to Devs
---

I'm currently the sole developer behind [glukit](http://www.mygluk.it) but, like I mentionned in my [intro post](/posts/introduction), I'm feeling a bit drained about the 17 months of uninterrupted work on it. Today, I'd like to call out to diabetic developers who would be interested in pushing [glukit](http://www.mygluk.it) further. 

### What's Coming
As of today, the main feature of glukit is the comparison with a "steady sailor". The steady sailor at the moment is the diabetic who has the best glukit score. And to make things more interesting, I've recently excluded myself from the pool of eligible users. 

The next features I'd personally like to see in [glukit](http://www.mygluk.it) are:

1.   a1c prediction
2.   ability to challenge a friend to be your steady sailor

Following that, I'd like to add more behavioral science nudges and potentially play with different ideas regarding the normative comparisons (aggregate comparisons with a "steady sailors" group and the average). 

There's also some ongoing efforts to enable 3rd party uploaders to push data to [glukit](http://www.mygluk.it) and enable people that aren't running on OS X to use it. 

### The Technology
Glukloader, the Mac OS X uploader is written in Objective-C. Glukit itself was written in [Go](http://golang.org/) (and yes! Go is a lot of fun and it's easy to learn) and runs on google app engine.
[glukit](http://www.mygluk.it)'s front-end uses the [gumby framework](http://gumbyframework.com/). Both Glukloader and [glukit](http://www.mygluk.it)'s code is hosted on github. 

### Get in Touch

If that sounds like something interesting to you, I think it could be a lot of fun. [Glukit](http://www.mygluk.it) is a fully functional app but I have a nice backlog of exciting features that I think would be awesome for it. If you'd like to give this a try, [talk to me](mailto:alexandre.normand@mygluk.it). I'd love to hear from you.

Peace,
